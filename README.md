# Gausian-Naive-Bayes-prediction
Using na√Øve Bayes method to predict labels in Iris dataset

This GitHub repository contains an implementation of the Naive Bayes classification algorithm for predicting labels of the famous Iris dataset. The project explores three different approaches: the traditional Naive Bayes, the Naive Bayes implemented using a custom library, and an optimized version of Naive Bayes. The main goal is to compare and contrast the performance of these approaches in label prediction on the Iris dataset.

## Dataset Overview
The Iris dataset is a widely used dataset in machine learning and pattern recognition. It consists of 150 samples from three different species of Iris flowers: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. Each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

### Approaches
Traditional Naive Bayes
In this approach, we implement the standard Naive Bayes algorithm from scratch. We assume that the features are independent given the class labels and calculate the posterior probability of each class for a given set of features.

### Naive Bayes Library
For a more modular approach, we develop a custom Python library for Naive Bayes classification. This library provides functions for training the model, making predictions, and evaluating performance. The goal is to create a reusable and understandable implementation.

### Optimized Naive Bayes
In this approach, we aim to optimize the Naive Bayes algorithm for the Iris dataset. This could involve techniques such as feature selection, parameter tuning, or utilizing more advanced variants of Naive Bayes, such as Gaussian Naive Bayes.

After running the different approaches, the results will be presented and compared. This includes metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for each approach. The results will help in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each implementation.
